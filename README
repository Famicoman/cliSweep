cliSweep 0.1
Mike Dank

Wrote this minesweeper console game back four years ago when I had some free time. 

You input your spaces using computer style coordinates (Top left is 0,0 bottem right is 9,9 etc). 
You can't label where you think there are mines though, which adds a layer of difficulty (let's call it a feature).
Placement of the the 10 mines is random on each launch.
